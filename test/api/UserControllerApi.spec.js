/**
 * Emaile2e API Documentation
 * [Email-e2e](https://emaile2e.com) is and end-to-end email testing service. It has a web-app for managing your account and a REST API for sending and receiving emails from randomized email addresses.  ## Why? Email-e2e was built to test the integration of email services within an app. If your application relies on the sending or receiving of emails, then Email-e2e will let you test that functionality. This is a more common need than you might think: if your app has a sign up process that requires email verification, how do you currently test that?  ## Getting started Every API request requires a valid API Key appended as a query parameter. **To obtain an API Key** [visit your account dashboard](http://www.emaile2e.com/dashboard).    The general flow is as follows:  - Create a new inbox during a test. The email address will be returned in the response.  - Send an email to that address or trigger an action in your test that does so. - Fetch the email for your new inbox and check if its content is what you expected, or use the content in another action.  ## SDK - There is an official [Javascript SDK](https://www.npmjs.com/package/emaile2e-client) available on npm. - You can also use the [swagger JSON definition](https://api.emaile2e.com/v2/api-docs) and [swagger-codegen](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-codegen) to generate a swagger client in a language of your choice.  ## Legal The Emaile2e API code is owned by [PettmanUG](http://pettmanug.site) and uses a proprietary [software licence](http://www.binpress.com/license/view/l/c8376a01eca7465027a978d3fde5a1e2). The SDKs are free to use in any project and have an ISC licence.  ## Bugs, features, support To report bugs or request features please see the [contact page](http://www.emaile2e.com/contact).
